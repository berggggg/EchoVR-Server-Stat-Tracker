# Echo VR Server Stat Tracker

This server stats viewer was briefly part of the [Windows Hosts Resources](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources). It has been deprecated as statistics and telemetry are now done through EchoVRCE. This repo is just for archival and reference purposes.

If it's your first time using the stat tracker, click the "Import Log Data" button to parse your server's logs.

Everything in `\_local\r14logs` and `\_local\r14logs\old` will be imported.

As of version 2.1.1, the 'Players Served' metric is counting unique players within the selected timeframe.
